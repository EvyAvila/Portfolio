# Description

Practice Makes Perfect is a console application text game made in Visual Studio 2019. It was inspired
from my experience in studying and performing music. The goal of the game is to have the player
make choices in preparations for a music competition by balancing their time to practice and their 
health. The main interactions the user has is the arrow keys to change the gameplay options and the
Enter key to select the options.
