Updates to my project 1:

- Updated the controls to use the new Input System.

- Created a script called MainObject, which is meant to deactivate 
when the player "picks up" the objects inside the rooms

- Created a script called PlayerInvetory. Its main purpose is to
hold on to the objects found around the rooms and add them to
inventory. Then, when the player returns to the alter, they "display"
the items they have currently using Linq.

- Created a script called EnemyMovement, which handles the movement
for the enemy that roam the hallways. I have some comment that I think
should be changed, but for the meantime left them as to test how it 
should function.

- Create a camera script that serves to follow the main player in
first person perspective. 

Update to my project 2:

Game starts in scene MainMenu. 
All parts are included and all work. Comments are set in each class
