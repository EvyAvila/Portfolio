# Description

The Altar Lure is a 3D escape room puzzle game made in Unity 2021.3.2f1. The goal of the game is to locate the items that 
are missing and return them back to the altar. Each room contains it's own puzzle or interaction in order to retrieve the object. 
While exploring, enemies roam the hallways in search for the player. The game was inspired by a Mexican tradition holiday
known as DÃ­a de los Muertos or Day of the Dead.
