# Description

La Cueva or The Cave is an application made in Visual Studio 2019 as a Windows Presentation Foundation or WPF. 
As the title suggest, it's an interactive ecosystem taking place inside a cave where the user must take care of animals,
bugs, and crops. Alongside the organisms is a shop to exchange for money and purchase materials. Finally, the user 
must manage their health as they manage the ecosystem. 

All the visual images were created in Photoshop.
